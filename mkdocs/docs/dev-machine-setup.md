# Development Machine Setup

!!! note
    If you have [winget](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/winget/) installed, (or Windows 11 in general), you can setup your machine automatically with [this script](/scripts#configure-local).
    
When setting up a new machine for development in UnAd, there is a standard list of tools to install.

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) is used for source control.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) is used for much of the APIs and other projects. (preferably via [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm))
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is used for container development.
- [AWS CLI](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/awscli) is used for AWS access and infrastructure management.

There are also many tools that are optional, but helpful.

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is used for all sorts of development tasks.
- [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) is used for convenient interaction with GitHub tools.
