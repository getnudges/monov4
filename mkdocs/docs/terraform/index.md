### `init`

The `init.ps1` script (the only one that lives at the root of this project) is a convenience script for loading the most common environment variables in a terminal session.  It reads from the `.env` file [set up here](/#initial-setup).  **Ensure this has been run in any new terminal session, as just about every other script depends on it's behavior.**
