# Using these docs

In order to serve these docs locally, you must first have [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) installed, then, in this directory, run the following commands.

```ps1
python -m venv .
pip install -r requirements.txt
./Scripts/Activate.ps1
mkdocs serve
```
This will start the server at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.
